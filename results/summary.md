## Results

The EPS simulation produced the following observable results:

- Solar power generation follows a periodic day–night pattern corresponding
  to orbital sunlight and eclipse phases.
- During eclipse periods, net power becomes negative and the battery
  discharges to support spacecraft loads.
- During sunlight, solar power exceeds load demand and the battery recharges.
- Battery state-of-charge (SOC) reaches a minimum near the midpoint of eclipse
  and a maximum near the end of the sunlit phase.
- Increasing the number of solar panels increases available charging power
  and raises the minimum SOC over an orbit.
- For low panel counts, SOC drops close to or below defined safety thresholds.
- Trade-study plots show a monotonic increase in minimum SOC with solar array
  mass.

These results are consistent across multiple simulated orbits and panel
configurations.
